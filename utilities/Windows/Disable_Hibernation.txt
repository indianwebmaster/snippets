The file C:\hiberfil.sys is anywhere from 4-16Gb on a typical PC. The location of this file cannot be moved to a different drive. However, the option to hibernate can be turned off altogether, which would delete this file.

Open a command window as administrator
Type 'powercfg.exe /hibernate off'

My note: You can turn hibernate off and then on again. The 'off' deletes the file and the 'on' will allow the file to be created at a later date if required.
