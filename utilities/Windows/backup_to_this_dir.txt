Use xcopy command to copy files over from a directory to another, skipping over files that are identical (and don't need to be copied)
E.g. Backup the dropbox folder to an external hard drive.

cd  to the dropbox folder
	(cd C:\Users\Public\Documents\Dropbox)
execute the command
	xcopy /f /e /c /i /h /r /d /g /y . "E:\Backups\Dropbox"

/f - Displays full source and destination file names while copying
/e - Copies any subfolder, even if it is empty
/c - Continues copying even if errors occur
/i - If the destination does not exist, and you are copying more than one file, this switch assumes that the destination is a folder
/h - Copies hidden and system files.
/r - Overwrites read-only files
/d - Copies all Source files that are newer than existing Destination files
/g - Creates decrypted Destination files when the destination does not support encryption
/y - Overwrites existing files without prompting you
