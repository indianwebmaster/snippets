Bootstrap Grid System
Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page. Group columns to create wider columns.
The following is a basic structure of a Bootstrap grid:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-*-*"></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-*1-*2”></div>
  <div class="col-*1-*2”></div>
  <div class="col-*1-*2”></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  ...
</div>

Where *1 is the class of grid
	xs (for phones)
	sm (for tablets)
	md (for desktops)
	lg (for larger desktops)

and *2 is the col spans which should add up to 12.
