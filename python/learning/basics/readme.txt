In every .py tutorial file, I will have blocks of commented code labeled as
#LEARN_n
where n is some number.
You want to "uncomment" the line following the "#LEARN_n" comment - with n being the same
for all the lines. e.g.
#LEARN_1
# my_py_var = []
#LEARN_1
# my_py_var[2] = 101
Uncomment both lines and execute the program. Once you are ready to move on, comment the lines back
and uncomment the next ones and so on.
