'''
    Numpy is a math library for python. It enables us to do computation efficiently, effectively and has amazing capabilities

    In numpy, array, matrix and vector and used interchangeably

    For multi-dimensional arrays, you specify as (num_rows, num_columns)

# shape() - returns (num_rows,num_cols) - see below for result for nplist and why?
# reshape() - transpose or convert to multidimension matrix
# zeros(tuple(nrows,ncols)) - create a matrix filled with (float) 0
# eye(n) - create an n x n Identity matrix (diagonals filled with 1. )
